# Latin Spellchecker
This is an unofficial backup of the full latest version of the Latin (la) spellchecker extension for LibreOffice & OpenOffice: https://extensions.libreoffice.org/en/extensions/show/latin-spelling-and-hyphenation-dictionaries

Development of the plugin has stopped, so creating this repository is a matter of digital preservation. If the project were to close down entirely, that would be a tragic loss for us scholars. Yet as long as the official download methods persist, those should be used instead.

## Usage
Every section of a document with "Latin" set as its language will have regular spellchecking automatically.

## License
The maker of this extension released it under the LGPL 3.0: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html
